# A/B Testing for Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
### Author: Virendrasinh Chavda

<p align="justify">
This repository contains the code and analysis for evaluating the impact of two marketing campaigns (Ad and PSA) on conversion rates using **A/B testing**. The project employs statistical tests such as the Chi-Square Test, Point-Biserial Correlation, and Linear Regression to measure differences in conversion rates and assess the effect of ad frequency on conversions.

## Overview
<p align="justify">
Money laundering is a sophisticated financial crime where illicit funds are disguised as legitimate. Traditional rule-based detection methods struggle with evolving and complex laundering schemes. In this project, we use **network analysis** techniques to detect money laundering by identifying central and suspicious nodes (accounts) in transaction networks. Centrality measures like **degree**, **closeness**, and **betweenness centrality** help uncover significant nodes. Additionally, community detection algorithms such as the **Girvan-Newman algorithm** are employed to isolate suspicious clusters of accounts.

<p align="justify">
Marketing campaigns are integral to driving customer engagement and conversions. In this project, we analyze A/B testing data to determine if different campaign strategies; Ad vs. PSA, significantly impact conversion rates. Using statistical tests, we assess if campaign type and ad frequency correlate with higher conversions and measure the practical impact of these factors on conversion likelihood. 
</p>

## Data:
<p align="justify">
The dataset used for this project includes anonymized user data on ad exposure and conversion outcomes, with the following key attributes:
</p>

* **test group**: Indicates the campaign type (`ad` or `psa`)
* **converted**: Binary variable indicating conversion (True/False)
* **total ads**: Number of ads shown to each user
* **most ads day**: Day of the week with the highest ad exposure
* **most ads hour**: Hour of the day with the highest ad exposure

<p align="justify">
For the purposes of this project, a subset of 2000 transactions was sampled and used for analysis due to computational constraints. Columns related to transaction type, timestamp, and fraud labels were excluded, focusing on **network properties**.
</p>

## Methodology:
### 1. Preprocessing
<p align="justify">
The dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and focusing on metrics essential for A/B testing, such as `test group`, `converted`, `total ads`, `most ads day`, and `most ads hour`.
</p>

### 2. Statistical Testing
<p align="justify">
The following statistical tests were conducted: 

* **Chi-Square Test**: To compare conversion rates between `ad` and `psa` groups.
* **Point-Biserial Correlation**: To measure the association between `total ads` and conversion.
* **Linear Regression**: To estimate the effect of `total ads` on conversion probability.
* **Effect Size Calculation (Cohen’s d)**: To determine the practical significance of ad exposure differences between groups.
</p>

### 3. Visualization
<p align="justify">
Visualizations included: 

* **Conversion Rate by Day and Hour**: Stacked bar plots for weekly and hourly conversion trends.
* **Conversion vs. Total Ads**: Scatter and box plots to visualize ad exposure differences by conversion status.
</p>

## Results:
<p align="justify">
* **Conversion Differences**: The Chi-Square test indicated significant conversion differences between the `ad` and `psa` groups. 
* **Ad Frequency Impact**: A positive correlation between `total ads` and conversion probability was found, with regression results showing a small but significant increase in conversion with ad frequency.
* **Effect Size**: Cohen’s d showed an extremely small practical effect, indicating that while statistically significant, the difference in ad exposure is practically minimal. 
</p>

## Future Work:
<p align="justify">
* **Incorporate Additional Features**: Adding data on user demographics and behavior could refine insights.
* **Longitudinal Analysis**: Analyzing conversion trends over time may reveal seasonality or time-sensitive patterns.
* **Machine Learning Integration**: Building predictive models using these results could enhance campaign targeting and optimization.
